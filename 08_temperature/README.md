# Case 8: Sunlit heating in a still-water pool

## Physical settings
- Geometry: a short trapezoidal channel with a central widening that forms a pool (region `pool`) embedded in the main plane (`reg0`). The left and right strings are defined but there is no imposed inflow/outflow; hydraulics start from rest with still water.
- Initial state: quiescent water surface at 4.0 m everywhere, zero velocities.

## Temperature configuration
- Temperature module enabled with uniform initial value 1.0 °C.
- A meteorological heat source is applied only over the widened pool region (`pool`):
  - Air temperature 20 °C, bed temperature 5 °C, relative humidity 80%.
  - Wind speed 5 m/s, shade factor 0.0 (fully sunlit), incoming shortwave radiation 400 W/m².
- Diffusion: constant coefficients with longitudinal = 0.2 m²/s and transversal = 0.2 m²/s. These values were chosen for demo purpose only.
- Fluid specific heat: 4186 J/(kg·K).

## Numerical settings
- Time window: 0–3600 s with 20 s output interval.
- Mesh: unstructured triangular mesh of 3,374 cells and 1,761 nodes. A preview of the mesh is shown below.

## Input files:
- **model.json**: physical and model configuration (mesh, regions, hydraulics at rest, temperature module with meteo forcing over `pool`). BASEMENT does not run directly from this file; it first writes `setup.h5` which the solver actually uses.
- **heating_pool.2dm**: unstructured triangular mesh required by BASEHPC. This mesh was generated by `heating_pool.py` and then used by the model. For details on the 2DM format, see the SMS documentation.
- **simulation.json**: solver controls (time window, timestep control) and requested outputs (`water_depth`, `flow_velocity`, `water_surface`, `temperature`). Used together with `setup.h5` to run the simulation.
- **results.json**: post-processing configuration to export `results.xdmf` from the HDF5 results for visualization.

## Computation statistics:
- Solver: BASEMENT (BASEHPC OpenMP build) on 16 CPU threads (12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1260P).
- Unstructured triangular mesh: 3,374 cells, 1,761 nodes.
- cpu-time = ____ s for 3600 s physical time.

## Post-processing & visualization:
- Load `results.xdmf` in ParaView and apply the saved state `08_temperature/ParaView/08_temperature.pvsm` to reproduce the views.
- An example animation (temperature field with water surface and vectors) is provided here:
